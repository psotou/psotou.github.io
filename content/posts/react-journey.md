## The start

So I decided to learn React since I've been quite curious about frontend development for quite a while now. 

I went with React becuase looking at the job market in my country it does seem like the obvious and reasonable choice, even though Vue is getting a lot of traction in Santiago, but I wanted to stick with the idea of learning the good old React.

Another very good reason for picking React and not somehting like Svelte is its metaframework NextJS.

After reading some blogs, reddits, and watching some youtube videos, Next seems to be a pretty mature and plainly good tool for building an e-commerce, which is my main short-term goal.

```golang
func main() {
    fmt.Println("holi")
}
```
