# Beyond a hobby

I always think, and in some rare occasions, tell other people how the should try to pursue a hobby, activity or whatever that might make them feel as alive as something you really feel passionate about. Whenever I think or say it, I try not to make it sound as a predicament ---sorry if it does some time, I swear it is not my intention.

I don't say this lightly. I constantly think about it becuase I've ---luckily--- found the activity that makes feel so good it hurts no to have it sometimes. Yeah, I know I sound like a junkie, but it is what it is.
