I&amp;rsquo;ve heard and read here and there that it was adviced to read The Rust Book (aka The Book) cover to cover before attempting to dive deep into the language.</description></item><item><title>React: baby steps</title><link>http://psotou.deno.dev/posts/2022-02-11-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 23:31:10 -0300</pubDate><guid>http://psotou.deno.dev/posts/2022-02-11-post/</guid><description>The start So I decided to learn React since I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite curious about frontend development for quite a while now.
I went with React becuase looking at the job market in my country it does seem like the obvious and reasonable choice, even though Vue is getting a lot of traction in Santiago, but I wanted to stick with the idea of learning the good old React.
Another very good reason for picking React and not somehting like Svelte is its metaframework NextJS.</description></item></channel></rss>
