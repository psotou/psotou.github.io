I went with React becuase looking at the job market in my country it does seem like the obvious and reasonable choice, even though Vue is getting a lot of traction in Santiago, but I wanted to stick with the idea of learning the good old React.
Another very good reason for picking React and not somehting like Svelte is its metaframework NextJS.</description></item></channel></rss>
